## Security Notes

There are some vulnerabilities in the dependencies that couldn't be fixed without breaking changes:
- 9 vulnerabilities (3 moderate, 6 high) related to:
  - nth-check
  - postcss (in resolve-url-loader)
  - webpack-dev-server

To fix these vulnerabilities, you would need to run `npm audit fix --force`, but this would install react-scripts@0.0.0, which is a breaking change.

## Recommendations

1. **Consider upgrading react-scripts**: The current version has security vulnerabilities. Consider upgrading to the latest version, but be aware this might require additional configuration changes.

2. **Test thoroughly**: After these version updates, thoroughly test all functionality to ensure compatibility.

3. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update dependencies to avoid using non-existent or outdated versions.

4. **Use package version locking**: Consider using tools like npm-check-updates to manage dependency versions.
